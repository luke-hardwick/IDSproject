# Which factors have the greatest influence in crime and sentencing?

---

# Sentencing and how it is affected by a potential criminals demographics

- The prison inmate disparities respective to the United states are widely publicized and well known. 

- Bias is predominantly towards the increased conviction of African american and Latino individuals.

- These individuals expereince also expereince unfair treatment within the system when compared to their white counterparts.

- I investigated these demographics as well as others within our prison system  to see if these biases were reflected within our own prison system. 

- focus on already incarcerated individuals and treatment

---

#initial cleaning and methodology

- prior to accessing the dataset it was corrupted.

- file type 

- "." used in place of NA

- problematic variable names


---

# the dataset

- acquired from 2021 review of the prison system and it's inhabitants

- over 10,000+ entries.

- the variables that I was particularly interested in were: sex, religion, ethnicity, age, punishment and punishment length.  

- contains all the internal punishments for all prisons within England and Wales in the year 2021.

- most interested in relationships able to be identified purely visually.

- abstract statistical concepts can't be understood by majority of the population.


---

# solitary confinement lengths

- the final punishment before escalating a crime to a criminal trial is that of solitary confinement. the legal maximum for solitary confinement for the purpose of punishment is 21 days in the UK

```{r solitary-age, echo = FALSE}

ggplot(data = solitaryage, mapping = aes(y = Age_group, x = mean_days_in_solitary)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs (
    y = "age",
    x = "average days in solitary",
    title = "average time an age group spends in solitary",
    subtitle = 
      "The average amount of time each age group spends in solitary when sentenced to it as punishment whilst already incarcerated"
  )

```


---

#classification of high risk inmates

- all inmates are objectively classified on their risk to the public and their potential risk to other inmates from A to being housed in a youth facility

```{r highriskreligion, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = categoryareligion, mapping = aes(y = religion, x = percentage)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs (
    y = "Religion",
    x = "proportion of people in high security establishments (%)",
    title = "percentage of Religions considered to be high security risks",
  )
```

---
# high risk inmates part 2

- female prisoners can legally be classified as class A however so far there is no Class A facilities for females which results in:

```{r highrisksex, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = categoryasex, mapping = aes(y = sex, x = percentage)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs (
    y = "Sex",
    x = "proportion of people in high security establishments (%)",
    title = "percentage of a sex considered to be high security risks",
  )

```

---

# Findings

- all variables i.e. sex, ethnicity, age and religion all had respective areas where one was being biased.

- those aged at polar ends of the spectrum experience lower times in solitary confinement.

- Muslims and Jewish people are more likely to be classified as high risk individuals as well as men.

---

#analysis

- Those in marginalized groups are more likely to be further discriminated and placed in groups of greater discrimination.

- Those traditionally perceived as the vulnerable i.e. the young and elderly are more likely to be treated more leniently.
