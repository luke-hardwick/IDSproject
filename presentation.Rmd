# Sentencing and how it is affected by a potential criminals demographics

- The prison inmate disparities respective to the United states are widely publicised and well known. Especially their biased statistic of having a majority African american comprised population of inmates.

- I decided to investigate these demographics within the prison system to see if they were reflected within our own prison system. 

- I decided to focus on how already convicted inmates were treated so the dataset I used was one of internal punishments in prisons. e.g. loss of privileges, solitary confinement, warning.


---

# the dataset

- the variables that I was particularly interested in were: sex, religion, ethnicity, age, punishment and punishment length.  

- contains all the internal punishments for all prisons within England and Wales in the year 2021.

- most interested in relationships able to be identified purely visually.

- abstract statistical concepts can't be understood by majority of the population.


---

# solitary confinement lengths

- the legal maximum for solitary confinement for the purpose of punishmen is 21 days in the UK

```{r solitary-age, echo = FALSE}

ggplot(data = solitaryage, mapping = aes(y = Age_group, x = mean_days_in_solitary)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs (
    y = "age",
    x = "average days in solitary",
    title = "average time an age group spends in solitary",
    subtitle = 
      "The average amount of time each age group spends in solitary when sentenced to it as punishment whilst already incarcerated"
  )

```

#classification of high risk inmates

- all inmates are objectively classified on their risk to the public and their potential risk to other inmates from A to youth facility

```{r highriskreligion, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = categoryareligion, mapping = aes(y = religion, x = percentage)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs (
    y = "Religion",
    x = "proportion of people in high security establishments (%)",
    title = "percentage of Religions considered to be high security risks",
  )
```

---
# high risk inmates part 2

```{r highrisksex, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = categoryasex, mapping = aes(y = sex, x = percentage)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs (
    y = "Sex",
    x = "proportion of people in high security establishments (%)",
    title = "percentage of Religions considered to be high security risks",
  )

```

---

#analysis 

- all variables i.e. sex, ethnicity, age and religion all had respective areas where one was being biased.
