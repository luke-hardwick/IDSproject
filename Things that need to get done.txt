For next week we should have a substantial part of the project done. We should centre our work around these core questions/goals:

. What demographic factor influence crime in particular regions/counties?
. How much does certain demographic factors incluence crime? (e.g areas with a lower mean household income would be expected to have a higher crime rate compared to areas with a higher mean household income)
. How does demographic factors influence sentencing?
. What factors have the greatest influence (both in crime and in sentencing)?

The demographic factors that I have in mind are these:

. Mean income (of region/county)
. Ethnicity
. Race
. Sex
. Nationality (Are they foreign-born or not)
. Poverty rate (of region/county) (ties in with mean income)

If you can think of any more write them here:

Work that needs to get done (by the deadline):

... Create visualisations of Crime by Region and County.
... Examine the relationship between demographic factors and crime (create visualisations)
... Construct probabilistic model of factors and crime rate (given these factors, what is the crime rate likely to be)
... Examine demogaphic factors and sentencing (visualisation, model)
... Report
... Presentation

I don't know how much of this gets done, just do as much as possible for the 24th.
I think the best course of action would be to split the workload. I'll start with the visualisations and create a model for factors and crime rate.
